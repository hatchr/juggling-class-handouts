# About
This is a place to store handouts for my juggling class and get feedback from the juggling community.

## 3-Ball Basics
This a syllabus outlining the (rough) order in which various juggling patterns will be taught. If someone tells me they "know the basic", these are the patterns and tricks that I'd expect them to know. (This is admittedly subjective!)

## To-Do List
- [ ] Create a handout for where to get balls.
- [ ] Create a handout for how to make balls.
- [ ] Add links to video tutorials. (These are intended to be used as printed documents, but perhaps we could include a QR code on each document to this repository.)
